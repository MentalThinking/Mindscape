# What is this?

Mindscape is my UI/System for the Aetolia mud, a combination of my own work and various public system releases. Its foundation is the Challenger Deep system, released by Lin to the Aetolia forums, with major additions from the Sunder public system, also of Aetolia in an effort to update Challenger Deep to modern Aetolia.

# Why is it called Mindscape if it's other systems?

Because I put a lot of effort into combining the two and adding my own tweaks and such and I wanted it to feel like 'mine' when all was said and done. It's neither of these two systems as they exist independently anymore.

# I want to use this system.

Go ahead. Note that it exists 'as is' with zero support and nearly no effort will be made on my part to be sure it'll work for anyone who isn't me or my characters.

# You should do \[this\] or \[that\].

Open an issue, if I agree, I'll do that.

# I see my code in here!

To the best of my knowledge, everything in Mindscape was released to the public domain with the express intent that it be used for exactly what I'm using it for. That said, if you are the originator of any of the code therein and would like express credit beyond what's here, contact me and I'll give it.
